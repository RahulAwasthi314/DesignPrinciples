I : Interface Segregation Principle

No client should be forced to depend on methods it does not use.

One fat interface need to be split to many smaller and relevant interfaces so that clients can know about the interfaces that are relevant to them.

This was first used and formulated by Robert C. Martin while consulting for Xerox.


Problem :

Xerox had created a new printer system that could perform a variety of tasks such as stapling and faxing along with the regular printing task.
