D : Dependency Inversion Principle

High level modules should not depend on low level modules. Both should depend on abstractions.

Abstractions should not depend on details. Details should depend on abstractions.

The interaction between high level and low level modules should be thought of as an abstract interation between them.

Introduced by Robert C. Martin.
