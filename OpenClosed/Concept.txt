O : Open Closed Principle

Software entities such as classes, modules, functions, etc. should be open for extension, but closed for modification.

Any new functionality should be implemented by addding new classes, attributes and methods, instead of changing the current ones or existing ones.

Bertend Meyer originated the term OCP

Robert C. Martin considered this as most important principle.


Implementation Guidelines:
	The simplest wat to apply OCP is to implement the new functionality on new derived classes.

	Allow clients to access the original class with abstract interface.


Why OCP :

if not followed 
	- End up testing the entire functionality
	- QA team need to test the entire flow
	- Costly process for the organization
	- Breaks Single responsibility as well
	- Maintenance overheads increase on the classes
