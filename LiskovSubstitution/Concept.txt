L : Liskov Substitution Principle

S is a subtype of T, then objects of type T may be replaced with object of type S.

Derived types must be completely substitutable for their base types.

Liskov Substitution Principle is a particular definition of a subtyping relation, called (strong) behavioral subtyping.

Introduced by Barbara Liskov

Extension of the Open Closed Principle


Implementation Guidelines
	No new exceptions can be thrown by the subtype.
	Clients should not know which specific subtype they are calling.
	New derived classes just extend without replacing the functionality of old classes
