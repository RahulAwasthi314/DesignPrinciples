S : Single Responsibility Principle

A class should have only one reason to change.

Each class and module should focus on a single task at a time.

Every member and property of the class should fulfil that single purpose.

Every module or class should have responsibility over a single part of the functionality provided by the softeare,
that responsibility should be entirely encapsulated by the class.

Goals : 
	Maintenance
	Testability
	Less fragile code
	Separation of concerns
	Loose Coupling between functionality and object

This would help to maintain the relationship between entity and behaviors by loose coupling and test them independently.
